# Test Case 039

Test case for when a feed-forward neural network appears in one of the observable formulas,
and one of the ML model input arguments is given via an array file that takes condition
specific vales.

## Model Structure

The SBML model for this problem is given as:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d} \text{prey}}{\mathrm{d} t} = \alpha \cdot \text{prey} - \beta \cdot \text{prey} \cdot \text{predator} $$

$$\frac{\mathrm{d} \text{predator}}{\mathrm{d} t} = \gamma \cdot \text{prey} \cdot \text{predator} - \delta \cdot \text{predator}$$

And the observable formula for `prey` is given by `NN[1] / 0.9 + prey` (the output from a
neural network).

## Data-Driven Model Structure

`N` is a feed-forward neural network with the following specification:

| LayerID | Layer                                                   | Activation Function |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| layer1  | Linear(in_features = 4, out_features = 5, bias = true)  | relu                |
| layer2  | Linear(in_features = 5, out_features = 10, bias = true) | relu                |
| layer3  | Linear(in_features = 10, out_features = 1, bias = true) | identity            |

The inputs to the network are given by `prey` (argument 0) and an array file (argument 1),
where the array file contains condition specific values.
